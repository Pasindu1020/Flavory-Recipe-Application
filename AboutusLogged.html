    <h2>How It All Started</h2>
    <p>
        Five passionate chefs, one shared dream—Flavory was born from a love for food and the desire to share it with the world. Shenuka's creativity, Pasindu’s comforting flavors, Isheni’s mastery of baking, Vimesh’s global inspirations, and Pramudi’s eye for innovation came together to build a space where anyone could find joy in cooking. What started as kitchen experiments and late-night food talks turned into a website filled with recipes that bring people together. Flavory isn’t just about food—it’s about stories, flavors, and the magic of cooking made accessible to all.
